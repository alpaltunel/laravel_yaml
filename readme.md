This is a sample project written by Alp Altunel about the assignment of Alban Sauvanet, Dunforce.
Project is not beautified with some css frameworks like bootstrap or tailwind.
Written with latest version of symfony because I already have it.
There could be improvements within the code of course like approval for delete, adding some placeholders for fields also adding validations for the user data.
But they all skipped because of the deadline.
